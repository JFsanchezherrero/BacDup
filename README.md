# Introduction

This is a pipeline for the identification and analysis of duplicate genes in bacteria.

The development of this research originally started at:

1. As a collaboration within the Genetics, Microbiology and Statistics department at University Barcelona, School of Biology (Github repository: https://github.com/molevol-ub/BacterialDuplicates) which lead to:

- **Duplicates in *Escherichia coli* genomes**: 

	Gene duplications in the E. coli genome: common themes among pathotypes. Bernabeu M., Sánchez-Herrero JF., Huedo P., Prieto A., Hüttener M., Rozas J. and Juárez A. **BMC Genomics** *2019 20:313*, https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-019-5683-4. Check [source code](https://github.com/molevol-ub/BacterialDuplicates/releases/tag/v1.0) and additional details and parameters [here](https://github.com/molevol-ub/BacterialDuplicates/blob/master/Ecoli/README.md).

- **Duplicates in Gram positive cocci**:
