The basic algorithm is simple and robust; it can be implemented in a number of ways and applied in a variety of contexts including straightforward DNA and protein sequence database searches, motif searches, gene identification searches, and in the analysis of multiple regions of similarity in long DNA sequences. In addition to its flexibility and tractability to mathematical analysis, BLAST is an order of magnitude faster than existing sequence comparison tools of comparable sensitivity.},

	abstract = {Resumen
Las bacterias gramnegativas multirresistentes son un grave problema de salud en todo el mundo. Ello se relaciona con la gravedad de las infecciones que pueden causar, las dificultades para establecer un tratamiento empírico (e incluso dirigido) correcto, la facilidad para la dispersión de la multirresistencia y la ausencia de nuevos antimicrobianos activos frente a estos patógenos. La antibioterapia debe, por tanto, basarse en el antibiograma, pudiendo requerir la combinación de antibióticos. La producción de beta-lactamasas de espectro extendido es el mayor problema actual de resistencia entre las enterobacterias, que causan infecciones nosocomiales, pero que también se están aislando en pacientes no ingresados. En nuestro entorno son menos relevantes, por el momento, las enterobacterias productoras de AmpC plasmídica o de la mayoría de las carbapenemasas. Todas estas variantes suelen presentar notables tasas de resistencia a aminoglucósidos y quinolonas, debido a que los plásmidos que codifican las beta-lactamasas también contienen genes de resistencia adicionales, o a que se seleccionan mutaciones cromosómicas adicionales. De entre los bacilos gramnegativos no fermentadores multirresistentes debe destacarse Pseudomonas aeruginosa, con elevada resistencia intrínseca y facilidad para adquirir resistencias adicionales, Acinetobacter baumannii, con crecientes tasas de resistencia a los antimicrobianos, y en menor medida Stenotrophomonas maltophilia.
Multiresistant Gram-negative bacteria represent a major health problem worldwide. This is related to the severity of the infections they cause, the difficulties for empiric (even directed) treatment, the ease of multiresistance spread, and the absence of new antimicrobial agents active against this group of pathogens. Accordingly, antimicrobial therapy should be based on the results of susceptibility testing, and may require using antimicrobial combinations. The production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases represents the most important current problem of resistance among enterobacteria; these organisms cause nosocomial infections, but can also be cultured from non-hospitalised patients. In our country, enterobacteria producing plasmid-mediated AmpC enzymes or most carbapenemases are still uncommon, at the moment. Enterobacteria expressing these types of beta-lactamases present high rates of resistance to aminoglycosides and quinolones, because plasmids coding for beta-lactamases also contain other genes involved in additional resistances and/or the selection of additional chromosomal mutations. Among multiresistant Gram-negative non-fermenting bacteria, the most clinically relevant organism is Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an organism with intrinsic resistance to multiple agents and with ability to capture acquired resistance mechanisms. Other organisms in the latter group include Acinetobacter baumannii, with increasing rates of resistance to antimicrobial agents, and to a lesser extent Stenotrophomonas maltophilia.},

Here, we report on the use of complete-genome sequencing in the characterization of spontaneously arising mutations in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our results confirm some findings previously obtained by indirect methods but also yield numerous unexpected findings, in particular a very high rate of point mutation and skewed distribution of base-substitution types in the mitochondrion, a very high rate of segmental duplication and deletion in the nuclear genome, and substantial deviations in the mutational profile among various model organisms.},

	abstract = {Gene amplification is a common feature of the genome of prokaryotic organisms. In this review, we analyze different instances of gene amplification in a variety of prokaryotes, including their mechanisms of generation and biological role. Growing evidence supports the concept that gene amplification be considered not as a mutation but rather as a dynamic genomic state related to the adaptation of bacterial populations to changing environmental conditions or biological interactions. In this context, the potentially amplifiable DNA regions impose a defined dynamic structure on the genome. If such structure has indeed been selected during evolution, it is a particularly challenging hypothesis.},

	abstract = {Gene duplications are a feature of bacterial genomes. In the present work we analyze the extent of gene duplications in the genomes of three microorganisms that belong to the Firmicutes phyluym and that are etiologic agents of several nosocomial infections: Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis. In all three groups, there is an irregular distribution of duplications in the genomes of the strains analyzed. Whereas in some of the strains duplications are scarce, hundreds of duplications are present in others. In all three species, mobile DNA accounts for a large percentage of the duplicated genes: phage DNA in S. aureus, and plasmid DNA in the enterococci. Duplicates also include core genes. In all three species, a reduced group of genes is duplicated in all strains analyzed. Duplication of the deoC and rpmG genes is a hallmark of S. aureus genomes. Duplication of the gene encoding the PTS IIB subunit is detected in all enterococci genomes. In E. faecalis it is remarkable that the genomes of some strains encode duplicates of the prgB and prgU genes. They belong to the prgABCU cluster, which responds to the presence of the peptide pheromone cCF10 by expressing the surface adhesins PrgA, PrgB and PrgC.},

	abstract = {The ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species) are the leading cause of nosocomial infections throughout the world. Most of them are multidrug resistant isolates, which is one of the greatest challenges in clinical practice. Multidrug resistance is amongst the top three threats to global public health and is usually caused by excessive drug usage or prescription, inappropriate use of antimicrobials, and substandard pharmaceuticals. Understanding the resistance mechanisms of these bacteria is crucial for the development of novel antimicrobial agents or other alternative tools to combat these public health challenges. Greater mechanistic understanding would also aid in the prediction of underlying or even unknown mechanisms of resistance, which could be applied to other emerging multidrug resistant pathogens. In this review, we summarize the known antimicrobial resistance mechanisms of ESKAPE pathogens.},

These mobile elements can have tremendous impact on their bacterial hosts’ genomes and phenotypes, which may lead to strain emergence and diversification, increased virulence or antibiotic resistance. However, finding prophages in microbial genomes remains a problem with no definitive solution. The majority of existing tools rely on detecting genomic regions enriched in protein-coding genes with known phage homologs, which hinders the de novo discovery of phage regions. In this study, a weighted phage detection algorithm, PhiSpy was developed based on seven distinctive characteristics of prophages, i.e. protein length, transcription strand directionality, customized AT and GC skew, the abundance of unique phage words, phage insertion points and the similarity of phage proteins. The first five characteristics are capable of identifying prophages without any sequence similarity with known phage genes. PhiSpy locates prophages by ranking genomic regions enriched in distinctive phage traits, which leads to the successful prediction of 94\% of prophages in 50 complete bacterial genomes with a 6\% false-negative rate and a 0.66\% false-positive rate.},

CARD focuses on providing high-quality reference data and molecular sequences within a controlled vocabulary, the Antibiotic Resistance Ontology (ARO), designed by the CARD biocuration team to integrate with software development efforts for resistome analysis and prediction, such as CARD’s Resistance Gene Identifier (RGI) software. Since 2017, CARD has expanded through extensive curation of reference sequences, revision of the ontological structure, curation of over 500 new AMR detection models, development of a new classification paradigm and expansion of analytical tools. Most notably, a new Resistomes \&amp; Variants module provides analysis and statistical summary of in silico predicted resistance variants from 82 pathogens and over 100 000 genomes. By adding these resistance variants to CARD, we are able to summarize predicted resistance using the information included in CARD, identify trends in AMR mobility and determine previously undescribed and novel resistance variants. Here, we describe updates and recent expansions to CARD and its biocuration process, including new resources for community biocuration of AMR molecular reference data.},

We report here the release of IslandViewer 4, with novel features to accommodate the needs of larger-scale microbial genomics analysis, while expanding GI predictions and improving its flexible visualization interface. A user management web interface as well as an HTTP API for batch analyses are now provided with a secured authentication to facilitate the submission of larger numbers of genomes and the retrieval of results. In addition, IslandViewer's integrated GI predictions from multiple methods have been improved and expanded by integrating the precise Islander method for pre-computed genomes, as well as an updated IslandPath-DIMOB for both pre-computed and user-supplied custom genome analysis. Finally, pre-computed predictions including virulence factors and antimicrobial resistance are now available for 6193 complete bacterial and archaeal strains publicly available in RefSeq. IslandViewer 4 provides key enhancements to facilitate the analysis of GIs and better understand their role in the evolution of successful environmental microbes and pathogens.},

The various combinations, organizations and expressions of virulence factors (VFs) are responsible for the diverse clinical symptoms of pathogen infections. Currently, whole-genome sequencing is widely used to decode potential novel or variant pathogens both in emergent outbreaks and in routine clinical practice. However, the efficient characterization of pathogenomic compositions remains a challenge for microbiologists or physicians with limited bioinformatics skills. Therefore, we introduced to VFDB an integrated and automatic pipeline, VFanalyzer, to systematically identify known/potential VFs in complete/draft bacterial genomes. VFanalyzer first constructs orthologous groups within the query genome and preanalyzed reference genomes from VFDB to avoid potential false positives due to paralogs. Then, it conducts iterative and exhaustive sequence similarity searches among the hierarchical prebuilt datasets of VFDB to accurately identify potential untypical/strain-specific VFs. Finally, via a context-based data refinement process for VFs encoded by gene clusters, VFanalyzer can achieve relatively high specificity and sensitivity without manual curation. In addition, a thoroughly optimized interactive web interface is introduced to present VFanalyzer reports in comparative pathogenomic style for easy online analysis.},
